                        The ancient Egyptian word for "cat" is "mau," which means "seer." When a cat died, its human family would shave their eyebrows
                        as a respectful sign of mourning.

                    Charlie's Origin Story
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Gray clouds churned the cold April sky. During a number of consecutive days of rain, my 4 year old daughter kept saying she
                    thought she heard a sound like a cat meowing. She discovered a tiny kitten up on a branch in a tall maple
                    tree near our driveway. Her grandmother was the only one there who was qualified to climb up on a tall
                    extension ladder, but she couldn't climb down while holding the kitten. So she dropped the kitten into
                    a blanket stretched out between a few small children.

                <h2>
                    Spotted Cat Types Identified
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Cats with white color in their coats are thought to have a mutant
                    <em>white-spotting</em> gene that prevents the fomation of stripes. Normally, the
                    <em>agouti</em> gene produces streaks of melanin in individual hairs and when assembled together, the cat
                    looks striped. Spotted cats can range from all white, to cats that are completely black except for a
                    few white hairs. Charlie is technically not a "tuxedo cat" because he has white paws on his back legs
                    as well as his front. The scientific term would be "mittens." He can be further classified as having
                    "low grade" white spotting of less than 40%. See category 4 on the chart:
