                                Feline genetics demostrate that around 1000AD Vikings developed a love for orange cats which they found near the Black Sea.
                                Viking outposts in Iceland, Scotland, and the Faroe Islands are home to unusually large numbers
                                of these cats. No one knows why the Vikings were so taken with orange cats. They are neither
                                especially good mousers nor particularly adapted well for living at sea on ships.

                    <h2>Not as advertised...</h2>
                    <p>
                        We adopted Pickles and Jack together. These kittens were a package deal becuase according to foster cat mother Trinity, they
                        had bonded and were best friends so it would be cruel to seprate them. I had two small children assist
                        in the interview process. Both cats were friendly, calm, and the orange cat, Pickles, would start
                        purring with just eye contact.</p>
                    <p>
                        The two cats are best friends and play together well. However, when I took Pickles into the vet to get him checked out. Even
                        though he was small and we were told he was a kitten, the vet looked at his teeth and sagging belly,
                        and said he was not a kitten at all, but an older cat who possibly was some kind of munchkin cat
                        or maybe his growth was stunted by hard living, malnutricion, paracytic infections, or maybe smoking
                        cigarettes from the looks of his teeth. It's nice when your vet has a sense of humor. We got his
                        teeth cleaned and he is doing well.

                        <h4>Orange Cat Quick Facts</h4>
                        <p> 80% of orange cats are male do to a chromosome mutation on the "X" sex-linked chromosome. This mutation
                            is recessive and requires two mutant "X" chromosomes in female cats, but any male cat with a
                            mutant "X" chromosome is expressed as orange. The orange color is caused my the presence of "pheomelanin"
                            which is produced by mutatations in the melanin producing genes. They are also called Ginger
                            or Marmalade cats.

                            My wife calls Pickles "Spice Cake" and insists he is too small and cute to be a boy cat and that he identifies as a girl.
                            She is completely supportive of Spice Cakes' decision and urges us all to respect her by not
                            referring to "her" as "him."

            <h2>The Strange Case of
                <em>Toxoplasmosis Gondii</em>
            </h2>

            <p>
                <em>Toxoplasmosis</em> is the reason pregnant women should not clean litter boxes. It can cause severe birth
                defects if the mother contracts it while pregnant. It is not a bacteria or virus, but actually an "obligate
                intracellular parasite." In humans it often migrates to the eye and is the number one cause of retinochoroiditis
                and accompanying retinal scars. Although only 3% of people infected have ocular manifestations, one can lose
                a significant amount of vision if that scar happens to be on a critical part of the retina, such as the macula.

                </div>
                <p>A really wierd thing is when mice are infected it affects their brains, and their behaviour changes. Cats
                    are not adversely effected. Mice, on the other hand become less risk adverse. Their reflexes are slowed,
                    working memory is impaired, and they develop an attraction to the odor of cat urine. Cats conveniently
                    find mice coming to them, and the cylcle repeats. </p>
                <p>In humans it also affects behavior. These effects take place as quickly as three weeks after infection, and
                    persist even after the paracyte has been eliminated. Reflexes are slowed and multiple cats are often
                    aquired. Additional studies could confirm if crazy cat ladies usually test positive. Male motorcyclists
                    are disproportionately affected. In a perverse twist, motorists of either sex who have
                    <em>T. gondii</em> are three to four times more likely to die in car accidents, either from their increased
                    disregard of the speed limit, or because the parasite wears down reaction times.

                <p> After killing mom for dinner, the two year old leopardess protected the baby from a pack of hyenas. In the
                    picture it shows the leopard gently giving the baby a bath. It would be interesting to know if the dead
                    mother tested positive for
                    <em>Toxoplasmosis</em>. The leopard's strangely timed display of maternal instint is still heartwarming.

                    A visionary leader in
                    <em>Toxoplasmosis</em> research is Jaroslav Flegr, an evolutionary biologist at Charles University in the
                    Czech Republic, who asserts "Toxoplasma might even kill as many people as
                    <em>malaria</em>, or at least a million people a year, " because of how it appears to change our response
                    to dangerous situations. While no evidence exists that cats genetically engineered this biological mind-control
                    agent, it does seem suspiciously convenient.
