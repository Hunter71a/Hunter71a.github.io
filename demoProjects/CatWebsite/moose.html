                <p>
                    My wife saw him on the  <a href="http://www.cahs-pets.org/" id="columbusHumane" target="blank">             
                Columbus Captial Area Humane Society Website</a> with his brother and sister and wanted him, and I was
                    tasked to "interview" and aquire the cat. After interacting with him, I didn't think he seemed very friendly.
                    He was reluctant to purr. I got into my car to leave and called my wife to let her know that Barrett
                    had failed the interview. She was at work talking to an important client on the other line. Work can
                    be stressful and she didn't have time to discuss, so she fervently shouted, "Get back in there.
                    <em>You're NOT leaving without my CAT!"</em> The connection clicked and she realized she had been mistakenly
                    still talking to the client, who hung up after a brief, awkward silence.

                <h4>
                    Speaking Cat: Cat Blinks
                </h4>
                <p>Cats will blink both eyes slowly to communicate trust or desire for friendship with humans or other cats.
                    Try it. If you want to convince a cat you are friendly, blink both eyes shut and hold for about a second,
                    and then open slowly. If the cat returns the blink, you've just exchanged a pleasant "hello" using cat
                    language.
