                            Cats have remarkable hearing. They can hear ultrasonic frequencies that help them hear mouse squeeks and localize prey. The
                            frequency range that can be heard extends 1.6 octaves above the range of humans and 1 octave
                            above dogs. A total range of 48Hz to 85kHz.
                        </p>
                        <p>Interestingly, since purring occurs at 24Hz cats can't hear themselves purr. Also, becuase of the
                            size of the cochlea in the inner ear, the sensitivity of low frequencies is not very good. Cats
                            find it harder to hear men talking than women because of the frequecies involved. By speaking
                            in an even higher pitch, as one would when talking to a baby, cats can hear and understand what
                            you are saying better. </p>
                        <p>"Meows" tend to be at this higher pitch as well, and it is easier for them to replicate the sounds
                            of baby talk to freely communicate with humans. Larger animals can generally hear lower frequencies
                            because having a larger ear helps. Elephants can hear sounds as low as 14Hz. Talk about pumping
                            up the bass!

                <h2 class="hAlign">Purring in the key of "G"</h2>
                <p>Purring results from the twitching of laryngial muscles at a very low frequency of 24hz, which would be an
                    octave below the lowest "G" on a piano. A kitten will add 380hz overtone to get help from its mother.
                    This tone is also strangely near a "G." 380hz is also the same pitch at which a human baby cries.
                </p>
                <p>The purpose of purring can include communication, but also signles contentment and happiness. The action
                    of purring has benefits to the body. Purring stimulates bone cells and massages the muscles. The purring
                    sound a cat emits benefits both body and mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    NASA has developed technology to help prevent the bone loss caused by weightless environments. The astronauts are exposed
                    to frequencies between 20hz and 140hz to benifit their bone health since they have no cats on the international
                    space station to purr.

                <h4>Welcome to our island, humans.</h4>
                <p>Aoshima is a tiny island in the Ehime Prefecture of Japan. It stands only 0.49km
                    <sup>2</sup> in size. </p>
                <p> Cats outnumber humans in this tourist destination which originally started as a small fishing village. Today
                    you can depart in a ferry from Nagahama and arrive in 30 minutes. Don't forget to bring catnip and treats!
                    Tourists can stay in cabins with cat ears.

                <p>Judging from the number of ginger cats at the pier to the ferry, one might speculate
                    <a href="pickles.html#vikings">Vikings</a> frequented this island at some point. An interesting study might look for the presence of
